# Some_ML_Algorithms_in_Tensorflow
This is a part of my independent study on deep learning. I benefited a lot from the textbook __Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow__ by __Aurélien Géron__, 
[click here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do). 
The code chunks are based on the textbook code blockes with some modifications. 

Thanks to Aurélien for such a great book.
