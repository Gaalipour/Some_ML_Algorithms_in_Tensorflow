# Some_ML_Algorithms_in_Tensorflow
This is a part of my independent study on deep learning. I benefited a lot from the textbook 
[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do). 
The code chunks are based on the textbook code blockes with some modifications. Thanks to Aurélien for such a gerat book.
